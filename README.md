Mobile application development on Swift, Kotlin, Dart

## Tasks
Laboratory work: Development of a mobile application using Firebase
The goal: To create a mobile application that will interact with the Firebase database for storing and managing data.

Basic requirements:

1. User Authentication:
- Use Firebase Authentication to register and authenticate users. Any interaction with the application is possible only for AUTHORIZED users.

2. The "List of Objects" screen:
- The application should display a list of homogeneous objects (for example, books, movies, hotels, etc.). There should be at least 30 objects in the list.
- When clicking on an object, users should be provided with detailed information about the object. This information should include a description and a slider with images, the ability to add to favorites, etc.
- For a minimum of 5 objects in the collection, at least 7 images of each must be provided.

3. Favorites screen:
- Users should be able to add objects to favorites and delete them from there.
- Data about objects in favorites must be stored in a remote database (Firebase).

4. The User Profile screen:
- Must contain at least 10 information fields (for example, name, date of birth, description, etc.) and log out
5. Integration with Firebase:
- All data (user profiles, information about objects) must be stored on Firebase.
- The functionality of creating and deleting users should be implemented.

6. Platform support:
- The application must be developed for iOS (using Swift), Android (using Kotlin) and Flutter (using Dart).
